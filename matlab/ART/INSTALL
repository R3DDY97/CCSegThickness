Installation for Linux systems:

You may need to be logged in as root, depending on the permissions of the directory
on which you are installing ART.

The rest of this document assumes that ART is installed in /usr/local/art.  However,
this need not be the case.

1. Unpack the package.

	cd /usr/local/art	# create this directory if it does not already exist
	gunzip art.tar.gz	# uncompress the archive
	tar xvf art.tar		# unpack the archive

2. Set the $ARTHOME environment variable. To set $ARTHOME, csh and tcsh users should 
add this line in their `.cshrc' or `.tcshrc' files: 

	setenv ARTHOME /usr/local/art

sh and bash users should instead add these lines in their `.profile' or `.bashrc': 

	ARTHOME=/usr/local/art
	export ARTHOME 

3.  Update your path.  For example, sh or bash users should add this line to their
`.profile' or `.bashrc':

	export PATH=$PATH:$ARTHOME/bin   		#Linux users
	export PATH=$PATH:$ARTHOME/bin_macg5   	#Macintosh G5 users
	export PATH=$PATH:$ARTHOME/bin_maci   	#Macintosh Intel users

4. Depending on your setup, you may need to install libraries: nifticlib, znzlib,
and openmotif in order for some of programs to work.
