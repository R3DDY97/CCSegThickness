Installation for Linux systems:

You may need to be logged in as root, depending on the permissions of the directory
on which you are installing acpcdetect.

The rest of this document assumes that acpcdetect is installed in /usr/local/art.  

1. Unpack the package.

	cd /usr/local/art	# create this directory if it does not already exist
	tar xvzf acpcdetect.tar.gz		# unpack the archive

2. Set the $ARTHOME environment variable. To set $ARTHOME, csh and tcsh users should 
add this line in their `.cshrc' or `.tcshrc' files: 

	setenv ARTHOME /usr/local/art

sh and bash users should instead add these lines in their `.profile' or `.bashrc': 

	ARTHOME=/usr/local/art
	export ARTHOME 

3.  mv the executable program: $ARTHOME/acpcdetect to a bin directory in your PATH.
