Functions of some of the programs included in ART:

3dwarper	
For 3D non-linear registration of high-resolution T1-weighted brain MRI scans.

acpcdetect	
Automatically detected the AC and PC landmarks as well as the mid-sagittal image on 3D T1-weighted and
T2-weighted brain MRI scans.  For T2-weighted images, option -T2 should be used.

analyze2nii
For converting ANALYZE format images to NIFTI format images.  Specify the orientation code using
the -O option.  See ``docs/acpcdetect.pdf'' for more information about orientation codes used in ART.

applywarp3d
Applied the deformation field vector outputted from the 3dwarper program to other images.

avgImage
Used to average several NIFTI images.

ivf
Used to invert the deformation vector field outputted from the 3dwarper program.

brainwash
Still under development.  Used for skull-stripping 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans.

unwarp2d
For 2D non-linear registration of brain MRI scans.  Mostly used to for susceptibility 
distortion correction in DTI by matched the b0 image to a conventional T2-weighted image.
The deformation vector field that is outputted from this program is the input to the -w2d
argument of applywarp3d

art2
GUI-based program for multi-modality rigid-body registration.  For example, this program 
is used to register 3D T1-weighted images to 2D multi-slice T2-weighted images of the
same subject.

reslice
Used to apply a transformation matrix of type outputted by art2 to other images.  This
program only works with ANALYZE images.

scaleImage
Used to multiply the image values by a constant.

acpcalign  
Computes a rigid-body transformation between two images using AC, PC, and mid-sagittal plane locations.

affinealign
Computes an affine transformation between two images using the output transformation matrix of acpcalign
(which must be inputed to this program) as a starting point.
